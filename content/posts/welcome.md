Hello and welcome to my personal website/portfolio/blog! I'm [Rasmus](/about), a Finnish computational chemist pursing a doctoral degree at Aalto University. This website will serve as a platform showcasing my background and interests, past and ongoing research projects and perhaps some more extensive blog posts in case I have something on my mind I think would be worth sharing. Stay tuned!

This site is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an (extremely!) fast and flexible open-source static site generator, and hosted through [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). This approach for setting up a website seemed quite convenient considering the version controlling benefits of GitHub and the simplicity of using pre-built custom [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files for content creation in Hugo. When rendering your website, Hugo takes care of formatting and organizing your content into `HTML` files, cutting you a lot of slack, yet leaving the door open for including richer custom layouts and templates using `HTML` or Hugo [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) if you so desire.
