Rasmus is a materials modelling and data science enthusiast pursuing a doctoral degree in computational chemistry at Aalto University. Since 2018, he has been exploring the structure and chemical reactivity of dynamic solid-liquid interfaces by means of numerical computer simulations. At interfaces the symmetries of the respective bulk materials are broken, thus forming potential sites for exciting phenomena such as the catalysis of chemical reactions. Notably, solid-liquid interfaces play a vital role in electrochemical devices, such as batteries, fuel cells and electrolysers, as their performance is ultimately determined by the numerous nanoscale phenomena that occur at the interfaces between the solid electrodes and the liquid electrolyte. Understanding these processes at the level of atoms and electrons is therefore essential in order to rationally design sustainable materials for renewable [electrochemical energy technologies](https://www.iea.org/articles/batteries-and-hydrogen-technology-keys-for-a-clean-energy-future), a topic which Rasmus is particularly passionate about.

The simulations Rasmus is running are based on the complex mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, more specifically [density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory), and would not be possible without the usage of [high-performance computing resources](https://research.csc.fi/csc-s-servers) and massively parallel [electronic structure codes](https://www.cp2k.org/). Interpreting the output data requires tailored analyses which Rasmus implements using primarily the Python scientific computing stack. Rasmus has a keen interest also in machine learning methods that he is convinced will advance materials science by enabling high-throughput modelling workflows and enhanced analyses of large datasets.

In his free time, Rasmus practices [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), a Japanese martial art the fundamental principle of which builds on the utilization and redirection of an attacker's momentum in order to execute soft counter-techniques with minimal effort and damage inflicted.
